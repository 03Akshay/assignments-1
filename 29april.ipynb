    "Q1. Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics or features. The goal of clustering is to divide the data into distinct groups, or clusters, such that data points within each cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. The main idea is to find natural patterns and structures within the data without any predefined labels.\n",
