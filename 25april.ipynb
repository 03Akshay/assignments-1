    "In general, for a square matrix A, an eigenvector is a non-zero vector v such that Av is a scalar multiple of v. The scalar multiple is called the eigenvalue associated with that eigenvector. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n",

    "If a matrix has multiple distinct eigenvalues, it can have multiple sets of linearly independent eigenvectors, one for each eigenvalue. Each set of eigenvectors corresponds to a different eigenvalue. The number of distinct eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that not all matrices have a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. Some matrices have repeated eigenvalues, which means a single eigenvalue might have multiple linearly independent eigenvectors associated with it. In such cases, the matrix is called \"defective.\" The number of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to a repeated eigenvalue is called the \"geometric multiplicity\" of the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues if it has distinct eigenvalues or if it has repeated eigenvalues with multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to each repeated eigenvalue."
